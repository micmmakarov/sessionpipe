Control (M6): `sessionpipe-core/control`, the one verifier for signed control commands (WebCrypto only, safe in Workers and browsers), with 60 shared conformance vectors; the control schemas rewritten for signed, per-machine delivery. The CLI ignores `sink add --control` (control is per machine) and a retried batch reuses its `webhook-id`.
