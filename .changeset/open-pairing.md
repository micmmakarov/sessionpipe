Open pairing: `sessionpipe control pair spacesheep.dev` needs no key where the receiver declares `control.open_pairing`. One link, one passkey approval; the daemon proves itself on the status poll with a `poll_key` only it holds, prints which account approved, and adds the sessions key the receiver hands over as its events sink (tier 0). A bare host means https, and a `--token` with a character no key has (a pasted `ss_…` placeholder) is refused in words.
