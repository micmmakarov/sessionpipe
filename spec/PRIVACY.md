# Privacy: tiers and rulesets

> This document is part of the sessionpipe protocol and is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](LICENSE). The words MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY are used as in RFC 2119. Status: **Draft** (see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md)).

Sessions are personal. A prompt names colleagues, a path names a client, a pasted
config carries a key. The protocol's answer is **data minimisation by construction**:
a sink gets a tier, the tier is an allowlist, and two rulesets scrub what remains.

## 1. Tiers

| Tier | Name | Carries |
|-----:|------|---------|
| 0 | presence | Session id, state events (`session.*`, `turn.started`, `turn.ended`, `attention.*` with only `attention_id` and `kind`), timing, machine, cwd, repo, branch, model, title, url, account_id. Enough for "working / needs you / done" and a link to open the session. |
| 1 | actions | + tool names, `call_id`, durations, ok/error text, `files.changed` paths, attention `tool` and `message` (redacted, ≤ 200 chars), `prompt_chars`, subagents, compactions. Enough for an activity feed. |
| 2 | conversation | + `turn.transcript`: the person's prompts and the assistant's text, redacted, ≤ 20 000 chars a side. Enough for memory, search, recaps. |
| 3 | full | + tool `input` and `output` (≤ 64 KB each), thinking where the harness exposes it, the native lane's raw lines. Full replay; meant for a receiver you own. |

Rules:

- **Allowlist per type.** `filter(event, tier, pii)` keeps, for each type, only the
  fields the table in [PROTOCOL.md §4](PROTOCOL.md#4-event-vocabulary) names at that
  tier or below, and drops the whole event when its type's tier is higher. It never
  works by removing named fields from an unknown shape. A field this spec does not
  mention at a tier is not sent at that tier.
- **Per sink.** A person may send tier 0 to a team board and tier 2 to their own
  memory. The tier is a property of the sink, not of the machine.
- **Capped by the receiver.** `max_tier` in the well-known file wins when lower.
  A receiver MUST 403 an event above its cap; it MUST NOT quietly keep it.
- **Default is 0.** A sink added by hand without `--tier` is tier 0. The installer
  asks once per sink, shows what each tier sends, and remembers the answer.
- **Every event says what ran.** `privacy.rulesets` and `privacy.pii` are on every
  event, so a receiver can tell an unredacted native-lane row from a client row.

## 2. Rulesets

### `secrets@1` (always, above tier 0)

Runs on every string an event carries above tier 0, before the event reaches the
outbox. It cannot be disabled per sink. It removes the **value** and keeps the
sentence: `password: [redacted]`. What it matches:

| Class | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Vendor token shapes | `ghp_…`, `github_pat_…`, `glpat-…`, `xox[abposre]-…`, Slack and Discord webhook URLs, `sk-…` (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenRouter), `sk_live_` / `rk_test_` (Stripe), `whsec_…`, `AIza…`, `ya29.…`, `GOCSPX-…`, AWS access key ids, `xai-`, `gsk_`, `pplx-`, `hf_`, `pcsk_`, `npm_`, `pypi-`, SendGrid, Shopify, DigitalOcean, Linear, Notion, Supabase, Figma, Doppler, Granola, spacesheep `ss_`, Telegram bot tokens, JWTs, PEM private-key blocks (including one cut off mid-paste). |
| URL credentials | `scheme://user:password@host` → the password goes, user and host stay. |
| Authorization headers | `Bearer`, `Basic`, `Token` followed by a credential. |
| Assignments | `NAME=value`, `NAME: value`, `NAME => value` where NAME names a secret (`DB_PASSWORD`, `apiKey`, `client-secret`, `*_KEY`, `*token*` …) — but not `password_hash`, `tokenizer`, `max_tokens: 4096`, and not a bare `pass:` (a count after "Verification pass:" is prose, not a credential). Only a secret name may consume a value, so `https:` never swallows a `?token=` behind it. |
| Prose | "password is Hunter2!", "the token was …", "set the password to …" — only when the value looks generated (letters and digits, or three character classes), so "the password is wrong" stays. |

Placeholders are left alone: `<your-key>`, `${VAR}`, `process.env.X`, `string`,
`[redacted]`, a member path, a call. The rules are **linear** (bounded repetition,
no nested quantifiers); the adversarial vectors pin that a 50 000-space run or
`password_` × 5000 returns in milliseconds. The ruleset is idempotent.

Vectors: `conformance/redaction/secrets.json`. The reference implementation is
`packages/core/src/privacy/secrets.ts`; every other copy (a server-side re-check,
a CLI) MUST import it or run its vectors.

### `pii@1` (opt-in, any tier)

A second pass, on by `--pii` per sink. It reduces identifiers, it does not promise
anonymity:

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Email addresses | → `[email]` |
| Phone numbers (E.164 and common national forms) | → `[phone]` |
| Home directory paths | → `~` (already the rule for `session.cwd`; here applied inside every string) |
| `session.machine` | → the first 8 hex characters of its SHA-256 |
| `session.account_id` | dropped |

Vectors: `conformance/redaction/pii.json`.

## 3. What a sender never reads

An adapter uses a harness's documented hooks API and reads files the person's own
harness wrote on the person's own machine (its transcript, its session registry, its
config's account id). It never reads a credential file, never calls a vendor API, and
never sends a token of the harness's anywhere. [ADAPTERS.md](ADAPTERS.md) states this
per harness with the documentation URL.

## 4. For receivers

*This section is guidance, not legal advice.*

Session events can be **personal data**: names in prompts, an account id, paths that
name a client or a colleague. If you operate a receiver for anyone but yourself, you
are the controller of what it stores.

- **The tiers are your data-minimisation tool.** Declare the lowest `max_tier` your
  purpose needs. A receiver serving more than its operator SHOULD declare `max_tier`
  ≤ 1.
- **`session.forgotten` is the deletion path.** Honour it fully (events, derived
  data, backups on their schedule) and say in your documentation how long that takes.
- **Document retention.** Say how long events are kept and delete on schedule.
- **Access requests** can be answered from the per-session file: the protocol's
  storage unit is one session's events, in order.
- **Secrets can still arrive.** `secrets@1` is good, not perfect; treat every stored
  string as though it might contain one. Never log event bodies.
- **The native lane carries unredacted data.** Do not enable it on a receiver other
  people send to.

## 5. What sessionpipe itself never does

- No telemetry: the client reports to the sinks the person configured and to no one
  else. The website has no analytics.
- No hosted receiver: the project operates no server that receives anyone's data.
- The optional daily version check is a plain read of the npm registry, off with
  `SESSIONPIPE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
