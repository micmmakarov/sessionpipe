# Contributing to sessionpipe

Thank you. This page is the whole process; if something here is unclear, open a
Discussion and we will fix the page.

## Dev setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/micmmakarov/sessionpipe
cd sessionpipe
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build        # esbuild bundles + declarations, per package
npm test             # vitest
npm run lint         # Biome
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run schemas      # regenerate schemas/v1 from packages/core/schema/v1.ts
```

Node ≥ 20. CI runs all of the above on Node 20 / 22 / 24 × Linux / macOS / Windows,
plus `npm run schemas -- --check` (generated files must match the commit), the
conformance fixtures, a secret scan over `conformance/`, and the hook-timing benchmark.

## The ten ground rules

Every PR is checked against these (they are the project's invariants, in
[README](README.md) and the spec):

1. **The spec is the product.** A behaviour lands in `spec/` with a fixture in
   `conformance/` before or with its code.
2. **One source per fact.** Schemas are generated from Zod, never hand-edited. The
   site renders `spec/*.md`. Redaction rules exist once, in core.
3. **The hook path is invisible.** `dist/hook.js` reads stdin, writes one job file,
   spawns a detached worker, exits 0 in under 150 ms p50. It imports only `node:` builtins.
   The one exception is control (spec/CONTROL.md §6): on a machine with control paired,
   a PermissionRequest hook may wait on the daemon's local socket for a signed answer
   (up to the hook's own window), and a Stop hook asks the socket for a queued message
   (a local round trip, ≤ 50 ms). Neither counts toward the 150 ms budget, and neither
   runs at all where control is not paired.
4. **Never lose, never duplicate.** Append-only outbox, cursor advances on 2xx only,
   `seq` per session, receivers dedupe on (harness, session, seq).
5. **Secrets never leave.** The secrets ruleset runs above tier 0 and cannot be
   turned off per sink.
6. **Tier per sink, capped by the receiver.**
7. **Code owns access, state and transport; interpretation belongs to receivers.**
8. **Adapters are the only vendor code** (`packages/core/src/adapters/<harness>.ts`).
9. **No telemetry, ever.**
10. **Public from commit one.**

## Adding an adapter

One PR, touching:

- `packages/core/src/adapters/<harness>.ts`: the mapping from the harness's hook
  payloads to protocol events, and where its config lives.
- `conformance/harness/<harness>/*.json`: **real** payloads recorded from the
  harness, one per event, secrets scrubbed (`npm run fixture-scan` must pass).
  Never invent a payload.
- `spec/ADAPTERS.md`: the harness's row (config file, events, ids, transcript path,
  quirks, the documentation URL, and the statement that only a documented hooks API
  and the person's own local files are used).
- Its unit tests under `packages/core/test/`.

`core` must not name a vendor outside `adapters/`.

## Proposing a spec change

Open a [spec proposal](https://github.com/micmmakarov/sessionpipe/issues/new?template=spec-proposal.yml).
It needs a motivation, the exact field change with its requirement level (RFC 2119),
the fixture that would prove it, and a compatibility statement (additive behind a
capability string, or breaking with a protocol integer bump). Decisions are by lazy
consensus: seven days without a maintainer objection, then a PR that carries the
spec text, the schema change (regenerated), and the fixture together.

## Sign-off (DCO)

Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by:` line with a real name and email,
certifying the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](DCO):

```sh
git commit -s -m "adapters: cursor afterFileEdit → files.changed"
```

There is no CLA. Inbound equals outbound: your contribution is accepted under the
license of the file it touches (Apache-2.0 for code, CC BY 4.0 for `spec/`).

## Commit and PR style

- One change per PR; the title says what changed, in the imperative.
- Include a changeset (`npx changeset`) when a package's behaviour changes.
- The PR template asks for the command output that proves the definition of done.
  Measure before claiming.
- Every source file starts with `// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.

## Review

A maintainer replies within five working days. Small fixes merge on one approval;
spec changes need a fixture and a maintainer approval after the seven-day window.
