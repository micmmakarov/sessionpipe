# sessionpipe

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8ae0d49: The sink drain packs events from many sessions into one batch of up to 50 (a first install's backfill is a handful of POSTs, not one per session); cursors move only after the batch was acknowledged.
- be95792: `sink test` sends a heartbeat and then its `session.forgotten`, so a receiver keeps no phantom session from the test.
- b8b8599: Fixes from the first outside install (Yaroslav Bulatov, issues #8–#14 and advisory GHSA-8f6f-c3c9-j5p6): a config file that is not plain JSON is never written back; installs keep a file's indent and final newline and uninstall deletes files sessionpipe created; jobs that lose the session-lock race are retried and swept, never lost; Claude Code `StopFailure` → `turn.ended` with `reason: error`; `status`/`doctor` say when Gemini CLI won't run hooks (`tools.enableHooks`) and word the Codex review honestly; `doctor` measures the wall clock a harness waits; with no sink above tier 0 only one tool event per harness is hooked; the npx bootstrap installs into `~/.local` when npm's prefix is Homebrew's versioned Cellar; a bare `pass:` is no longer a secret name; the outbox holds redacted strings at rest in 0600 files under 0700 directories.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c75aaa0: Core: adapters for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and Antigravity; the secrets@1 and pii@1 rulesets and the tier filter; outbox, cursors, locks; file, stdout and HTTP sinks. CLI: install, uninstall, sink, status, doctor, tail, backfill, forget, replay, update; the hook entry imports only node: builtins. Conformance: adapter fixture runner.
